    Abstract = {The aim of this study is to improve on the current diagnostic accuracy of elastic scattering spectroscopy by adopting an approach based on Bayesian linear methods, in particular Bayesian variable selection methods in logistic regression. The method attempts to automatically identify a small number of wavelengths that are most informative of the cancerous/pre-cancerous class label. This is potentially useful since rather than using broadband spectrum, a small groups of selected wavelengths bands may be used without significant loss of diagnostic accuracy, which will simplify the data collection by using photon detector. We also tried the approach which penalizing large local changes on the weight factors which will potentially help understanding the physical correlation and interpretations about components of the signals which are important for diagnosis.

We apply the method to three independent dataset (High Grade Dysplasia in Barrett's Oesophagus (BE), metastastic breast cancer in lymph nodes, and malignancy in skin lesions) and compare the diagnosis accuracy with conventional SVM and LDA. The technique selects around 15 critical wavelengths, without significant degradation in test performance.For example, for Barrett's Oesophagus, based on a balanced test dataset of equal numbers of pre-cancerous and cancerous samples, the method predicts with an accuracy of 74\% (This would give a specificity 87\% and sensitivity 60\%), competitive with the conventional state-of-the-art techniques.},

abstract="There is no uniform approach in the literature for modelling sequential correlations in sequence classification problems. It is easy to find examples of unstructured models (e.g. logistic regression) where correlations are not taken into account at all, but there are also many examples where the correlations are explicitly incorporated into a---potentially computationally expensive---structured classification model (e.g. conditional random fields). In this paper we lay theoretical and empirical foundations for clarifying the types of problem which necessitate direct modelling of correlations in sequences, and the types of problem where unstructured models that capture sequential aspects solely through features are sufficient. The theoretical work in this paper shows that the rate of decay of auto-correlations within a sequence is related to the excess classification risk that is incurred by ignoring the structural aspect of the data. This is an intuitively appealing result, demonstrating the intimate link between the auto-correlations and excess classification risk. Drawing directly on this theory, we develop well-founded visual analytics tools that can be applied a priori on data sequences and we demonstrate how these tools can guide practitioners in specifying feature representations based on auto-correlation profiles. Empirical analysis is performed on three sequential datasets. With baseline feature templates, structured and unstructured models achieve similar performance, indicating no initial preference for either model. We then apply the visual analytics tools to the datasets, and show that classification performance in all cases is improved over baseline results when our tools are involved in defining feature representations.",
